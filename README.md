# Deep-Learning-GAN-
Part of Udacity Deep Learning Nano Degree.  This is the project I submitted as part of the Face Generator assignment.
I used Deep Learning GAN's to generate faces, usinng TensorFlow Python API.

There were two datasets in this project:

MNIST  - for an intial test on digits
CelebA - the faces.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have revolutionized deep learning by accurately modeling real world data better than any model developed before. You'll learn from Ian Goodfellow, the inventor of GANs, how to build a generative model and use them to create realistic images.
